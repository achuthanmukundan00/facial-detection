# facial-detection
My first, basic face detection app using OpenCV 4.1.1 and Python 3.6

*Run the python file and pass in one of the included (or your own) sample image as the first argument. Pass in the cascade classifier XML as the second argument.*

*i.e. `python facial-detection.py RDJ.jpeg haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` should analyze the photo of Robert Downey Jr. and detect his face.*
